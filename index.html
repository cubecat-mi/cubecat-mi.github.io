        <h2 id="beginning">The Beginning</h2>
        <h6 class="beginning-post">Posted: June 2nd, 2020</h6>
        
        <p class="beginning-post">The title of this post is a bit of a lie. Today was not the true beginning of my dive into the world of computer programming, but it is the beginning of my documentation on the matter. </p>
        <p class="beginning-post">We are now comfortably (though begrudgingly) settled into about 2.5 weeks of <em>lock down, social distancing</em>, and general disruption of "normal" life as we knew it due to the global epidemic known as COVID-19. The difficult to track nature of how this new virus infects people and the unknown cure leading to tens of thousands of fatalities to date have forced us to drastically change the way we work, learn, interact, and live. Experts have decreed <strong>social distancing</strong> the best way to counteract the virus, which had led to the mandatory shut down of all <em>non-essential</em> businesses, schools, parks, events, and even personal visits between family and friends. People are instructed to stay home, to not interact with anyone outside of their immediate household, and maintain a minimum distance of 6ft or 2m from other people while going out for <strong>essential items only</strong> such as food, perscriptions, etc. </p>
        <p class="beginning-post"> Naturally, thousands of people have lost their jobs while the rest (who can) have transitioned to working remotely from home. Now, my whole career has revolved around the entertainment industry; notably theatre and live corporate events. Naturally, as all events and gatherings of 5 people or more have been banned due to the virus, I am one of the many who has been laid off, and laid off indefinitely. My last job didn't even get to officially begin before the virus cancelled everything. Due to a toxic environment from previous employment, I took a 2 month contract with the Vancouver Opera - note I live in Toronto on the opposite end of Canada to Vancouver - to get a change of scenery and figure out what I wanted to do with myself. This previous toxic workplace of mine had me second guessing viability of a career in the industry and I was considering maybe trying something else, learning something new, and potentially persue a different career path. I signed my new 2 month contract, gave my two weeks notice at my current job, and on my last day at that job, March 15th, 2020, COVID-19 was more or less declaired an epidemic and <em>every theatre and live event across North America was cancelled</em>. And with it, my new oppertunity in Vancouver. </p>
        
        <p class="beginning-post"> It was difficult at first. Grasping the notion that I was unemployed, with no prospective future to become employed any time soon. There were a lot of unknowns. <em>And entire industry had shut down</em>. Not just live events, but the film/tv industry too. Studios were shutting down, productions were being put on hold. Every single one of my friends and peers whom I had gone to theatre school with and worked with on various productions were all out of work. My entire network of resources for job oppertunities was completely useless, and also in the same position as me. Now, when a global disaster that sigularly shuts down the industry you were questioning your place in, if that is not a sign to move on to something different, frankly, I don't know what is. And thus, my journey towards computer programming begun.</p>

        <h2 id="something-new">Something New</h2>
        <h6 class="something-new-post">Posted: June 2nd, 2020</h6>
        
        <p class="something-new-post">I was exctied to learn something new. I felt the same way when I had started that toxic job a little over a year ago. I <em>love</em> to learn new things. Honestly, I think I <strong>need</strong> to learn new things. Otherwise the day to day becomes wrote and I lose motivation. Knowing this about myself, combined with the acknowledgement I also <em>love</em> to problem solve, I figured I'd go ahead and try to learn some coding. Also, a job that could easily be worked remotely, espeically these days, has it's appeal. The stars seem to be aligning...</p>
        
        <p class="something-new-post">I've always been interested in computers and learning new software has always been pretty natural for me. With no formal training I inevitably became the unofficial "office IT person" at my old jobs, just because I knew how to format something or where to find certain files or had a more robust understanding of how cloud sharing software worked over my coworkers. I remember when I was 10 or 11-years-old I had taught myself basic HTML so I could customize my NeoPets webpages to my likling. But that was almost 20 years ago now, and computers and technology have come a long, long way. Where do I even start?</p>
        
        <p class="something-new-post"> Admittendly, I'm not very good at starting new things. Particularly things without any direction. Complete blank slates. I tried some cursory Googling, reading blog posts of peoples experiences getting into programming, advice, questionaires to determin "is this right for you". Sites with lists and lists of free, and paid, resources and courses available. But no set "just do this one frist". Just a huge, intimidating mass. I'm new to all this. How do I know which course to take first when I've got pretty much zero background in any of it. Luckily, I am not facing all this change and uncertainty alone. I've got a wonderful partner - this June 22nd marks our 10 year anniversary - to back me up and help me through this. He found some people like me who were looking for help in how to get into coding and what other people had suggested to them. And that's where I found this course on Khan Academy. </p>
        
        <p class="something-new-post">Then as the saying goes, the rest is history. Well, not quite. I'm still very much a coding baby and am still learning the basics. To date, I've finished the first course under the <strong>Computer Programming</strong> track: <em>Intro to JavaScript</em>. Having no previous knowledge of JS, I quite enjoyed learning about it and the format of Khan Academy really works for me. It solidified my decision to continue learning. </p>
        
        <p class="something-new-post">I am now almost half way through <em>Intro to HTML/CSS</em> here on Khan Academy. For the early moduals on HTML I've had the foundation of 10-year-old me to build on, so I've been breezing through so far. It's been great to learn CSS though as a companion to HTML, and to updated my vary dated and preliminary knowledge of HTML to begin with.</p>
        
        <p class="something-new-post">Finally, yesterday I enrolled in the <strong>HarvardX <em>Intro to Computer Science</em></strong> course that is offered for free on edx. I am excited to start that, and continue with my journey (and now blog) here on Khan Acadmey.</p>

	<h2 id="cs50">HarvardX: CS50</h2>
        <h6 class="cs50-post">Posted: June 5th, 2020</h6>
        
        <p class="cs50-post">As mentioned in my last post, I enrolled in HarvardX's free online course <em>Intro to Computer Science</em> also known as <strong>CS50</strong>. Earlier this week, I started the course. The flow of said course consists of a video lecture (the first one was about 1hr long) and a problem set or project pretaining to the topics discussed in lecture and to be handed in. The lecture itself went over the basics of computer science as the course assumes some attendees may have zero previous knowledge about the subject. It was a well explained, with compelling examples and demonstrations, lecture that defined some terms I have already beoming familiar with through this course I'm taking on Khan Academy but was happy to be refreshed on. The professor explained binary and how it works, then how an algorithm might work when posed with a problem (his examples, searching through the phone book for a specific person). The latter half of the class was dedicated to teaching the class about <strong>Scratch</strong>; a visual based "drag and drop" programming software that uses puzzle pieces as the coding language to make games, animations, ineractive experiences, etc. Scratch uses many similar principles I have just learned through the <em>Intro to JavaScript</em> on Khan Academy, but with puzzle piece blocks instead of written functions. Unsurprisingly, the first problem set or assignment for this "Week 0" of CS50 is to make a progam in Scratch.</p>
	
	<p class="cs50-post">For my Scratch project, I decided to make a Cookie Monster themed game. I scribbled some ideas on functionality and what the game would look like in a notebook and the next day I began to figure out how to make my idea in Scratch. It took a couple hours of testing and referring to other peoples programs for me to figure out how the puzzle pieces worked compared to how I would have programed it in JavaScript. Once I figured out the flow of it, I was able to chip away at my project. First I had to figure out how to make my Cookie Monster sprite move side to side when the player pressed the left and right arrow keys. Next I had to figure out how to make my cookie sprites fall from the sky and continue doing so while spawning at random along the x-axis. Finally, I added a second "costume" to Cookie Monster so it appeared like his mouth chomped closed after successfully catching a falling cookie. I also added a "chomp" sound effect to go off every time he ate a cookie. I spent maybe 3 hours or so getting all this working in Scratch and decided to call it a day and continue implementing more later. </p>

	<p class="cs50-post">The next day I continued work on my Cookie Monster project; officially named <strong>"Cloudy with a Chance of COOKIES"</strong>. With the base functionality working, I added a couple different background scenes. I added a "Start" screen, instructing the player to begin by pressing the spacebar. I added a speak bubble to Cookie Monster instructing the player to use the arrow keys to move. I added a "Game Over" screen and thought about what I could add that might trigger it. I added a second type of cookie that was worth more points and behaved differently from the regular cookies that fell from the sky. I decided to add some clouds to the top of the screen, both for easier visibility (the background I chose for the game made it a little difficult to see when the cookies spawned) and to relate back to the title "Cloudy with...". That also gave me the idea for how the "Game Over" screen might be triggered. I added lightning sprites that moved/behaved differently again to my other two falling sprites, and made a thunder sounds when spawned, and when Cookie Monster was stuck with one it would end the game. </p>

	<p class="cs50-post">Now, my game was almsot complete, though it lacked an end game or reason to play. I thought for a while it would just be score based, so I had Cookie Monster keeping track of the score with a speech bubble. But that seemed kind of boring and not very compelling a reason to play. I decided to take away showing a score and instead just used the score behind the scenes to trigger next "levels" of the game. So, first, when the game begins, only chocolate chip cookies fall from the sky and are worth 1 point. Once Cookie Monster ate 5 points worth of cookies, the peek freens would then begin to spawn. The would appear along the top for a second before falling twice as fast as the chocolate chips cookies, and were wroth 2 points. Once Cookie Monster ate 20-21 points worth of cookies, he would alert the player about the strom getting worse, then the deadly lightning bolts would beginning falling iradically from the sky. If Cookie Monster got hit by one, it was game over, but if instead he ate 30-31 points worth of cookies, the end game screen would change to "Hooray the storm has passed" and would mark the end of the game. I also added the song "C is for Cookie" sung by Cookie Monster that plays while the game is going just for fun. For a bit I had the end game win screen set to go off once the song was done, then realized a player could "win" the game just by waiting it out and not eat a single cookie, so I changed the win screen condition to relate to the number of cookies scored. There still isn't really much of a compelling reason to play, other than to feed Cookie Monster cookies (since he loves them so much) and not die to a lightning bolt. </p> 

	<p class="cs50-post">Overall it was successful in teaching me how to use Scratch, even though I'm not the most creative when it comes to the actual game idea. Hopefully I can get better at coming up with said ideas, mechanics and design (though I know from experience in other industries design was never my strong suit) the more I practice and get into this course. It looks like after Week 8 of CS50 I get to choose a stream: <strong> games, mobile, or web</strong>. I'll likely go for the games one, since they are of my interest. We'll see how things progress though. Though I do love games, a part of me worries that I will be signing myself up for another low paying, workaholic-type industry and turning a hobby I enjoy into work. I'm not sure that web development has my particular interest yet, and I'm pretty indifferent about mobile development so I guess we shall see. I'm trying not to romanticize anything too much, but I think I already know I'm going to inevitably drift the closest to games. Next week's CS50 lecture we will be learning C.</p>

	<p class="cs50-post"> In the meantime, with my first CS50 project handed in, I'm still trying to squeeze in time on Khan Academy to continue learning. I've almost completed the <em>Web Development Tools</em> module and only interrupted myself from completing it to use what I've just learned about how to use Desktop editors to code HTML and open them in browsers by doing so to this blog and add this new post. For now I've just tested it out using Microsfot Notepad. It does work, but is pretty limited in features (aka has none) so there is no colour coding or anything and some of the built-in features Khan Academy uses are not supported (or at least didn't work when I opened it in browser). I'll likely try a more robust editor soon. I've also got a lot more to learn about formatting things better, as right now though functional, my blog is pretty ugly... One step at a time!</p>
